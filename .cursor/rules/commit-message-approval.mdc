# Git commit message approval

Before running `git commit` in this project:

1. **Propose** the commit message in your response (e.g. in a short blockquote or code block).
2. **Tell the user** they can approve it or suggest a different message.
3. **Only run** `git commit -m "..."` after the user has approved (e.g. "ok", "use it", "good") or provided their preferred message.

Do not run `git commit` in the same turn where you propose the message unless the user has already said to go ahead. If you need to commit as part of a multi-step task, show the message first and wait for approval, or run the commit in a follow-up after they confirm.
